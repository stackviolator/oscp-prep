Passive info gathering == recon == osint

Cyclic process repeating at different places in the engagement
	next step depends on what the last step's results were
	helps in many aspects: phishing, password guessing

Interpreations of "passive"
	strict - never interact with the target at all
	looser - interact as a normal user would, visit the website, sign up for something, but not testing the website for vulns
	best to confirm with the client what they want

Note taking
	Take notes when youre gathering info
	no right or wrong way kinda...
	its only wrong if you cant find/digest the data you collected :)

Website recon
	things to look for
		employee emails, twitter/ social media accounts
			employee emails might follow a designated pattern and/or OG employees might have a different pattern

Whois enumeration
	whois - tcp service tool to make queries about the registration of a domain
	megacorpone.com example:
		registered under Alan Grofield, who is the "IT and security director"
	whois can perform reverse lookups and normal lookups (domain name or ip addresses)

Google "hacking"
	i put it in quotes
	using google operators to sequentially narrow down search results
		starting with a broad search and moving from there
	site operator
		narrows the search results to just one domain name
		site:megacorpone.com
		can narrow down using other operators such as filetype or ext (extension)
		- (minus) operator, exclude search results
	intitle:"index of" "parent directory" to find pages that contain "index of" in the title and the words "parent directory" on the page.
	google hacking database - place to find google queries that are mean
		https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database
	intitle:"Apache Flink Web Dashboard"

Netcraft
	web service that offers information gathering techniques
	doesnt work without a mf payment plan ughhhhhh

Recon-ng
	BHIS tool that displays and stores results in a DB
	add modules from the marketplace using "marketplace search"
	some modules need api keys, markets with an * in the "K" column

Open source code
	various different places to find code
	can be used to show the tech stack of the company, rare occasions secrets or sensative info has been committed
	Github
		search function is flexible, can do something like filename:users
		couple tools are useful such as gitrob and gitleaks, as well as recon-ng modules
	GitLab
	SourceForge

Shodan
	Crawls devices connected to the internet
	requires an account and a subscription now :(

Security headers scanning
	specialty sites that scan read the headers of http responses and such
	get a basic idea of coding practices and standards at a company

SSL Server test
	SSL Server Test from Qualys SSL Lab
	https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
	compares a websites SSL config to best practices

Pastebin
	website for storing and sharing text

User information gathering
	grunt work
	used in phishing campaigns, targeted credential stuffing, building userlists, etc

	Email harvesting
		finding employee emails from a variety of public places
		theHarvester - https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester

	Password dumps
		checking previous password dumps for people from a domain
		dehashed, haveibeenpwned, etc
