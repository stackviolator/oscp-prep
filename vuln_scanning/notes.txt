manual testing and scanning is definitely better than automated, although automated has its place

Overview and considderatins
	How scanners work
		General workflow
			1. Detect if a system is up and running
			2. Conduct a full or partial port scan
			3. Identify the OS running
			4. Identify running services using banner grabbing, service behavior, file discovery, etc
			5. signature-matching to find vulnerabilities
			Generally what we do manually, some help from automatic and verifiable use of signature matching
			essentially pulling strings from the service banner, cutting the service ID out of it like "OpenSSH_7.9p1 Debian-10"
				some scanners will also use an auto exploit feature
			opportunity for false positives and false negatives
				false positive - backporting, package maintaners roll back the software version to a previous patch
			always confirm the vulnerabilities flagged by scanners

	Manual vs automated scanners
		best tactic is to combine manual and automated, best balance reveals itself over time
		Manual testing requires lots of resources, time consuming
		Red teaming needs to be precise and minimize network presence, therefore automated scanners are no bueno
		automated scanners are needed on big engagements under a time constraint
		automated scanners can have harmful defaults - automatically try to brute force passwords
